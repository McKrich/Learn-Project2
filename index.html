        <h1>Physical Sciences</h1>
          <p>According to Wikipedia, the physical sciences are a branch of natural science â€“ natural science is a major branch of science that tries to explain and predict nature's phenomena, based on empirical evidence. In natural science, hypotheses must be verified scientifically to be regarded as scientific theory. Validity, accuracy, and social mechanisms ensuring quality control, such as peer review and repeatability of findings, are amongst the criteria and methods used for this purpose. Natural science can be broken into two main branches: life science (for example biology) and physical science. Each of these branches, and all of their sub-branches, are referred to as natural sciences. Here I will post discoveries from famous scientists of the past and present and I will explain these discoveries and their importance.</p>

        <h1>Social Sciences</h1>
          <p>According to Wikipedia, Social science is a major category of academic disciplines, concerned with society and the relationships among individuals within a society. It in turn has many branches, each of which is considered a social "science". The social sciences include, but are not limited to, economics, political science, human geography, demography, management, psychology, sociology, anthropology, archaeology, jurisprudence, history, and linguistics. The term is also sometimes used to refer specifically to the field of sociology, the original 'science of society', established in the 19th century. Here I will show off anything I have noticed in a days encounter with people and talk about anything in society that is interesting and why it is.</p>
